# AHTM - Android Hacking Tools Manager

AHTM is my command-line tool designed to manage various Android hacking tools easily. It allows users to install, uninstall, and list tools with simple commands.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal tool I use to manage Android tools in my projects, as I often forget how to install some of them and/or it takes time to go through the installation process for many of them. All scripts that may affect the system when the tool is executed are located under the **tools/** folder (you can review them yourself). I know itâ€™s not perfect and may have bugs, but it saves me time. In short, it works.
Docker has only been used for development
