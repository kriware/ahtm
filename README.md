# AHTM - Android Hacking Tools Manager

AHTM is a command-line tool designed to easily manage various Android hacking tools. It allows users to install, uninstall, and list tools with simple commands.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal tool I created to manage Android tools in my projects, as I often forget how to install some of them or it takes time to go through the installation process for many. All scripts that may affect the system when the tool is executed are located under the tools/ folder (feel free to review them yourself). While I know it’s not perfect and may have bugs, it saves me time. In short, it works. Docker has only been used for development purposes.

## Features

- **Install Tools**: Easily install popular Android hacking tools.
- **Uninstall Tools**: Remove tools that are no longer needed.
- **List Tools**: View all available tools and their installation status.

## Installation

- `pip3` (Python package installer)
- **Operating System**: Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian 10 (may work on other Linux distributions).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
